# Data-Analytics-Demo
Data Analytics Demo

This project was created to demonstrate my data analytics and coding skills.  I have long had an interest in the Nculear power industry and chose it for my data analysis case.

This project is segmented into two sections- a data analysis program created in Jupyter Notebook and a webpage displaying the files generated.  

To run the data analysis code, open the file "Nuclear Data Demo" and follow the instructions.  Sample plots from the demo are already created and stored in the graph folder.

To see the data displayed in the web page, open the "NuclearData.html" file in the main folder.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project, and if you have any questions please feel free to email me at mpaca3@gmail.com.
